## Overview

As we introduced CMS Model Field aliases in v5.33.0, we introduced a new property on our CMS Model Field definitions, the `Storage ID` (`storageId`) property.

### What Is the `Storage ID` Used For?

We use it as the storage path for the given field value in the record. As `fieldId` is now changeable, we cannot store values by the `fieldId` value because it would result in the data loss each time the `fieldId` value has changed.

### How Is the `Storage ID` Generated?

The `Storage ID` field comprises out of the field `type` property (`text`, `number`, `object`, etc...) and the `id` property, which is generated via the `nanoid` library.

Here are few examples how the `storageId` property value looks like this:
* `text@gbureq32f`
* `object@cbare1kaf`

We are basically joining the field `type` and the `id` properties, because it makes it easier to target the specific field types with custom mappings in the Elasticsearch system deployment.

The `storageId`  value is immutable, and it should never change, no matter what.
