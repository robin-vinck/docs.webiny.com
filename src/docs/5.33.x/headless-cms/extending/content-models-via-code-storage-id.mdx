## Overview

As we introduced CMS Model Field aliases in v5.33.0, we introduced a new property on our CMS Model Field definitions, the `Storage ID` (`storageId`) property.

### What Is the `Storage ID` Used For?

We use it as the storage path for the given field value in the record. As `fieldId` is now changeable, we cannot store values by the `fieldId` because it would result in the data loss, each time the `fieldId` is changed.

### How Is the `Storage ID` Generated?

The `Storage ID` field comprises out of the field type (for example, `text`) and the CMS Model Field `id` property, which is generated via the `nanoid` library.
The `Storage ID` value is immutable, and it should never change, no matter what.
