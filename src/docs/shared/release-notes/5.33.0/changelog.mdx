## Headless CMS

### CMS Model Field Aliases [#2611](https://github.com/webiny/webiny-js/pull/2611)

Starting from 5.33.0 we introduced `aliases` for the CMS Model Fields.

We are now allowing our users to change the `Field ID` (`fieldId`) property of the CMS Model Field definition, which serves as the field identifier in the GraphQL API and in the code.
As the `Field ID` property is now changeable, we needed another property to identify the field in the database, so we introduced the `Storage ID` (`storageId`) property.

If you have existing CMS Models defined via plugins, please read [this](/docs/headless-cms/extending/content-models-via-code-storage-id) article before you start the upgrade .
